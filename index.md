FORGE (Facial Optimization for Robust Generative Enhancement Attack) introduces a novel adversarial attack strategy to disrupt deepfake customization in latent diffusion models (LDMs). Our method leverages Face-Parsing-guided perturbation amplification and Superpixel-based random noise scaling to selectively apply adversarial perturbations to perceptually important facial regions, optimizing the trade-off between attack effectiveness and visual imperceptibility. Moreover, we integrate **Expectation over Transformation (EoT)** to improve robustness against various image transformations, allowing our perturbations to remain effective against compression and geometric modifications. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ and VGGFace2 demonstrate that FORGE significantly reduces perturbation visibility while maintaining defense performance compared to existing approaches.

## Background
Recent advancements in latent diffusion models (LDMs) have enabled highly realistic face synthesis, raising concerns over unauthorized identity replication and privacy violations. Existing anti-customization methods introduce noticeable perturbations, limiting their practicality. FORGE addresses these issues by selectively applying adversarial noise to high-textured facial regions while minimizing distortion in smooth areas.
